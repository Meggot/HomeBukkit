Provides a home system for Bukkit

--UPDATED 13/04 by Meggot.

Added a default home system that if no args are entered for /sethome creates a default home with the string "%&%&defaulthome&%&%"
This home is not listed in the /listhomes and if no args are entered for /home it automatically goes to this
home location. This is because it is more intuitive and like other Home plugins already available.
